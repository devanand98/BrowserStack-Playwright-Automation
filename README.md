This project demonstrates how to use Playwright for automating browser interactions on BrowserStack. It includes tests for logging into a demo site and performing an item purchase action, using the playwright-python library and BrowserStack as the cloud testing service.

Prerequisites
Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.6+
Playwright (via pip)
pytest
A BrowserStack account
Set your BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME and BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY as environment variables or replace them in the script.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/browserstack-playwright-automation.git
cd browserstack-playwright-automation
Install the required Python dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
requirements.txt should contain:

txt
Copy
Edit
playwright
pytest
Install Playwright dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
playwright install
Set your BrowserStack credentials:

Either set the following environment variables:
bash
Copy
Edit
export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=your_browserstack_username
export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=your_browserstack_access_key
Or replace the placeholders in the script with your actual BrowserStack credentials.
Running the Tests
Once everything is set up, you can run the tests with pytest:

bash
Copy
Edit
pytest test_script.py
The script will run two tests on BrowserStack:

Login Test: Automates logging into the demo website.
Item Purchase Test: Automates adding an item to the cart and completing the checkout process.
Both tests use Playwright to interact with the page and will mark the test status (pass/fail) directly on BrowserStack.

Test Results
The results for each test will be reported on the BrowserStack dashboard. After running the tests, you can log into your BrowserStack account and view detailed session information, including screenshots and logs for each step of the test.

Example Output
You will see test results for each session similar to this:

Test Login: Passed (User successfully logged in)
Test Item Purchase: Failed (Order not placed)
